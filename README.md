### Tech used to make the website.
- React, Vite, Material UI.
- Deployed on netlify.
- Used netlify functions to send contact form as email with nodemailer

### Key learning takeaways.
- [React context can be used to iteratively provide different context to individual components](https://github.com/Yuzulix/NabePeroVideo/blob/3c96af8a61a23e181fe8ff56a8f66cb9cf5c64cf/src/components/videoGrid/VideoGrid.jsx#L64-L66) 
- Material UI is great for quick start, but can be difficult to customize.
